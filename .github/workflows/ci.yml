      # We need to set proper Pagefile limits in advance.
      # Github actions default page file size is quite small,
      # it's not enough to run all tests, especially when using None GC.
      # We've observed that on Unix memory management is less strict,
      # you can reserve more memory than it's physically possible.
      # On Windows however you need to reserve/commit memory in advance -
      # it does not matter whether it would be used or not, the amount of all
      # reserved memory cannot exceed the amount of physically available storage.
